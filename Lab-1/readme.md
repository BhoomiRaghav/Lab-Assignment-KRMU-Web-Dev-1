# Personal Portfolio 

## 👩‍💻 Project Overview
This is a single-page personal portfolio website built using **only HTML** as part of my Web Development Lab I Assignment.  
It showcases my profile, projects, technical skills, and includes a functional contact form — all within one page.

The project demonstrates my understanding of **semantic HTML structure**, accessibility, and internal navigation.
